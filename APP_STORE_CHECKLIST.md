### App Privacy Nutrition Label

**Required in App Store Connect:**

Apple requires detailed privacy "nutrition labels" showing what data is collected and how it's used.

**Data Types to Declare:**

- [ ] **Health & Fitness**
  - Health data collected: ✅ Yes
  - Linked to user: ✅ Yes (unless fully anonymized)
  - Used for tracking: ❌ No (health apps typically don't track for advertising)

- [ ] **Identifiers**
  - User ID: ✅ Yes
  - Device ID: ✅ Yes (if used for authentication)

- [ ] **Usage Data**
  - Product interaction: ✅ Yes (if using analytics)
  - Crash data: ✅ Yes (if using crash reporting)

- [ ] **Contact Info**
  - Email address: ✅ Yes (if account required)
  - Name: ✅ Yes (if collected)

**Privacy Label Configuration Example:**

```
Data Type: Health & Fitness
├─ Data Used to Track You: NO
├─ Data Linked to You: YES
│  ├─ Heart Rate
│  ├─ Blood Pressure
│  ├─ Steps
│  └─ Sleep Data
└─ Purpose:
   ├─ App Functionality
   ├─ Analytics (if applicable)
   └─ Product Personalization
```

**⚠️ Critical Requirement**: Privacy labels must be 100% accurate. Misrepresenting data collection is grounds for immediate rejection and potential removal from App Store.

### Privacy Manifest (Required as of May 2024)

  - File → New → Resource → App Privacy File
  - Add to app target

- [ ] **Declare Required Reason API Usage**

## Common Rejection Reasons

### Top Rejection Reasons for Health Apps

1. **Insufficient HealthKit Permission Justification**
   - **Reason**: NSHealthShareUsageDescription is generic or unclear
   - **Fix**: Be specific about which data types and why
   ```xml
   ❌ Bad: "We need access to your health data"
   ✅ Good: "We need access to your heart rate, blood pressure, and
            sleep data to provide personalized health insights and
            track your wellness trends over time."
   ```

2. **Requesting Unnecessary HealthKit Permissions**
   - **Reason**: App requests access to data types it doesn't use
   - **Fix**: Only request permissions for data types actively displayed or used
   ```swift
   ❌ Bad: Request access to all 70+ HealthKit data types
   ✅ Good: Request only heart rate, BP, steps, sleep
   ```

3. **Medical Claims Without Disclaimer**
   - **Reason**: App makes medical claims without proper disclaimers
   - **Fix**: Add prominent disclaimer on first launch and in app description
   ```
   ✅ Required: "This app is for informational purposes only and is not
                a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis,
                or treatment."
   ```

4. **Privacy Policy Issues**
   - **Reason**: No privacy policy, inaccessible URL, or policy doesn't cover health data
   - **Fix**: Create comprehensive, accessible privacy policy specific to health data

5. **Inaccurate Privacy Labels**
   - **Reason**: Privacy nutrition labels don't match actual data collection
   - **Fix**: Conduct thorough audit of all data collection and update labels

6. **App Crashes on Launch**
   - **Reason**: Critical bug or missing dependencies
   - **Fix**: Extensive testing on multiple devices and iOS versions

7. **HealthKit Not Working in Simulator**
   - **Reason**: Submitted without testing on real device
   - **Fix**: Always test HealthKit functionality on physical iPhone

8. **3rd Party Analytics Tracking Without Disclosure**
   - **Reason**: Using Firebase, Mixpanel, etc. without declaring in privacy labels
   - **Fix**: Declare all third-party SDKs in privacy nutrition label

9. **Sharing Health Data for Advertising**
   - **Reason**: Selling health data to advertisers or using for ad targeting
   - **Fix**: Never use health data for advertising; explicitly state in privacy policy

10. **No Account Deletion Option**
    - **Reason**: App requires account but doesn't allow deletion
    - **Fix**: Implement account deletion with complete data removal

### How to Respond to Rejection

If your app is rejected:

1. **Read Rejection Carefully**
   - Review message from App Review team
   - Note specific guideline violated
   - Check if additional information requested

2. **Fix the Issue**
   - Address the specific concern raised
   - Don't just resubmit without changes

3. **Respond in Resolution Center**
   - Explain what was fixed
   - Provide additional context if needed
   - Include screenshots or videos demonstrating fix

4. **Request Expedited Review (if applicable)**
   - Critical bug fix
   - Time-sensitive content
   - Use sparingly

5. **Appeal if Necessary**
